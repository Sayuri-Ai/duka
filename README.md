App Description:
    
    Based on my past 5 years on the campus space, I have seen many students run small businesses that 
    either provide services or sell products. These small student businesses were mainly run to either 
    raise income that they can use to support there families at home or just as a side hustle to add to
    the amount of money they already receive. Most of these businesses relied on poster marketing and sometimes 
    social media for those who were able to pay for the advertisement of there content on various student run pages 
    suchs as UCTJust Kidding.
    
    With the onset of covid19 most of this small student businesses failed completely and some of them 
    have not beenn  able to go back to there serices or product deliveries yet. This is because, with the 
    current wave, very few students visit campus premises and thus the poster marketing they highly relied 
    on doesn't work anymore. 
    
    Therefore, I decided to create an application that will help connect this small student businesses to 
    students in various institutions. In this platform students can showcase the various services that they provide 
    or products that they sell. Students are then able to place orders on the platform for product sales or 
    book appointments for services.
